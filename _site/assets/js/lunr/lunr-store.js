        "title": "Reconfigurable Vehicle Buck",
        "excerpt":"Vanderbilt University · Fall 2024 – Spring 2025  Aaron Gothard, Nick Diaz, David Guiracocha, Elijah Holland, Nicole Yeh   Overview   As part of my senior design capstone, I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team to design and fabricate a full-scale reconfigurable vehicle packaging buck for Nissan. The buck enables physical exploration of different interior layouts and cargo configurations for early-stage vehicle development and consumer research.   Our goal was to create a modular, human-centric platform that supports rapid testing of seating arrangements, cargo space layouts, visibility studies, and ingress/egress ergonomics. The final deliverable was delivered to Nissan for use in market research and concept validation.   Vehicle Design Background   In the context of vehicle design, there are a few terms to understand before we can dive into the details:     The vertical members that are typically on either side of the door are called pillars. The foremost pillar (in line with the instrument panel) is called the A Pillar. As you move rearward, the next pillar is called the B Pillar, and the pattern continues.   There is an invisible horizontal plane that splits the waistline in half, called the waistline or beltline. This means each pillar is divided into two members: the above-waistline portion and the below-waistline portion   When you look at a car from the front or the rear, its pillars typically angle in above the waistline. This angle is referred to as the tumblehome angle      Task Specifications  In total, there needed to be 11 variable dimensions:     Overall Width: The buck needed to expand and contract to simulate different widths of vehicles   B, C, D Pillar Locations: Each of the 3 rear pillars need to be able to translate fore and aft. The A Pillars do not need to translate, as they are used as the datum for the other pillars to locate off of.   Waistline Height: The waistline of the buck needs to raise and lower   Tumblehome Angle: The above waistline pillars need to be able to pivot inwards to give a variable tumblehome angle   Windshield Angle: On top of the A Pillar’s tumblehome pivot needs to be another joint to allow for the rearward sweep of the windshield to be adjusted.   Roof Height: The above waistline pillars need to also lengthen and contract to raise and lower the roof   Seat Position: The front and rear seat tracks need to move fore and aft, vertically up and down, and the front seats need to slide side to side.   With so many points of articulation, we were worried that the frame wouldn’t be rigid enough for consumers to sit in, so Nissan decided that the base needs to hold a load of 400kg excluding its own weight. Additionally, they requested that the frame must be made from 8020 aluminum extrusions and include casters for ease of use.   My Role  Since I front-loaded my degree requirements, I had the lightest semester out of my group. As such I took on a heavier workload when it came to bringing Nissan’s dream into reality.           Concept Development  Led early brainstorming for each of the vital joints and sourced parts for each. Most of the joints came from the 8020 website, as it offered off-the shelf operability for some of the simpler parts            3D Design  Designed the assembly in SolidWorks and validated geometric design criteria for each requirement. Ran simple load analysis to validate load requirements. Designed custom brackets for fitment and telescoping joints for above and below waistline pillars            Fabrication  Milled each of the custom parts, cut members and floors, and assembled 700+ individual components in this SUV-sized behemoth            Collaboration  Managed communication between our team, Dr. Withrow, The Wond’ry, LASIR, and Nissan Americas at every step of the journey       Technical Tools Used      SolidWorks for 3D modeling and detailed part drawings   Laser cutting and 3D printing (ULS 150D, Stratasys F170) for early prototypes   Milling (Sharp Vertical Knee Mill) for custom brackets and telescoping members   Ergonomic tools for interior dimension benchmarking (SAE J1100-based)   Impact   This project gave Nissan a valuable physical asset for iterative interior design testing and informed early vehicle development decisions with real user data. It also gave me hands-on experience designing human-focused systems and collaborating with an industry partner on a real-world engineering challenge.   Reflection   This project was one of the most meaningful parts of my undergraduate experience, career. Requiring I put in over 170 hours of work, it combined engineering fundamentals, hands-on prototyping, user research, and real industry feedback into a single, cohesive challenge. Working with Nissan pushed me to think not just as an engineer, but as a designer solving problems for real people.

        "title": "Bone Biopsy Phantom",
        "excerpt":"The Wond’ry · Summer 2022 - Fall 2023   Overview  Performing bone biopsies is hard. You must blindly drill through hard outer bone while expertly feeling the resistance in the drill. Once you feel you’ve made it through the hard cortical bone, you must begin taking a core sample of the inner medullary bone. If you miss that feedback and drill too deep then you must restart, causing unnecessary pain and inconvenience to the patient. Typically, training someone to perform a biopsy requires the use of cadavers or willing participants, which is cumbersome and requires unnecessary resources.   Design and Fabrication  In this project, in collaboration with VUMC’s Dr. Nick Chadwick, we made a trilayer phantom leg bone with a variable bone thicknesses. The top layer was a layer of soft silicone meant to mimic the soft tissue found in the thigh. This presented our first challenge, the stiffness of the soft tissue is variable along the thickness of the leg. The inner portion is dense with muscules, but the outer portion is fattier and softer. When deciding on a silicone, we picked one with a hardness that is an average between the two.   The innermost layer is the soft, medullary bone. This is a frustrum made in a silicone mold from a high density expanding foam. It tapers between two diameters, corresponding to the thinnest and thickest medullary bones a human would have. Once the foam is molded, it is inserted into a 2 part mold. The outer, cortical bone is an epoxy that is poured around the medullary bone. This epoxy has a durometer value that is comprable to the real thing (a bit harder than real life, but this is better for training purposes). Once this epoxy hardens, the bone nests perfectly within the soft tissue layer.   Results  The benefits of this training medium cannot be overstated. It can rest on any old shelf without special care, it can simulate all conditions of bone, and it can be reused and repurposed as needed. The soft tissue can be replaced if it is worn, and the bone can be repoured and replaced once it is swiss-cheese. It would be cheap to reproduce and easy to make in-house.   This project is currently in the process of recieving a utility patent, US Patent application no. 18/309,362. I am listed as an inventor, which is quite exciting!  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Extrusion Blow Molding Machines",
        "excerpt":"Graham Packaging Company · Summer 2023   Overview   Plastic bottles are everywhere, but they have to start somewhere. Typically, they find their start at an extrusion blow molding machine. This is a machine that blows compressed air through a hollow parison of hot plastic until it expands into the shape of the mold. At Graham Packaging Company in Bowling Green, KY, I had the opportunity to assist in the installation of two new Graham Wheels. A Graham Wheel is a style of blow molder in which a wheel of molds rotate around a center shaft, giving ample time for all the steps of molding without wasting time waiting on individual molds to free up. Each of these lines is currently capable of producing over 200,000 bottles per day.   Installation  Throughout this process, I worked with a team of full-time project engineers. I first worked on Value Stream and Process Mapping for the existing lines of production. This ensured I understood the underlying processes, and also gave me something to do while contractors ran necessary electrical and water lines. Once this was completed, we installed the large Graham Wheel, its extruder, and its accompanying systems of conveyors, trimmers, and labellers. This process took most of the summer to complete. Once this was completed, I helped the team of process engineers dress and hang the molds, and profile the bottles.   Profiling  Profiling is the process through which the thickness of the bottle is determined at each height of the bottle. If you didn’t know, bottles are not one continuous width when the parison is extruded. No, the parison has a variable width to ensure that there is no cracking at corners, the threads on the cap can hold, and the flat sides of the bottle remain so. Profiling is a complex task typically achieved through days of trial and error, especially when you’re working with machinery built in the early 1950’s. Once the bottle is profiled, the settings are locked in and qualification begins!   Qualification  Qualification is a rigorous process by which the factory must prove that the bottles it is manufacturing meet the qualifications set out by the customer. In this case, there are a few tests which must be passed by every bottle before the customer can purchase any stock:     Drop test - A test similar to a dunk tank at a carnival, only hopefully without any water outside the filled bottle   Leak test - Filled bottles have their levels measured, caps affixed, and then are put on their side to determine if there are any leaks   Dimensional accuracy - Neck diameter, circularity, and thickness is measured to ensure it is within tolerance   Mass measurement - Bottles must be below a certain weight of plastic to be profitable and for the customer to be happy   We were able to complete this full process for line 5 before my summer came to an end, but line 2 was just barely installed before I left. Today, both lines are up and running and pumping out bottles for BP, Valvoline, Idemitsu Kosan, and more.

        "title": "Semaphore Translator",
        "excerpt":"Vanderbilt University · Spring 2023  Aaron Gothard, Saksham Sharma, Julia Quilici   What is a Semaphore?  Flag Semaphore codes originated in 1866, as a method of communication between ships to replace shutter semaphores that were placed on lighthouses Flag semaphores utilize two square flags that a person can hold in one of 7 positions. These positions step through ¾ of a circle in steps of 45 degrees.      By numbering each arm position 1-7 and separating flags by their independent positions, 2-digit indices can be created that will identify any position.   Hardware      DAQ Board   Accelerometers(2)   Custom accellerometer wrist mounts   3v Power Supply    The wrist mount for our accelerometers with velcro straps sewn in   Code Overview   The structure of our code followes one large flat sequence. This ensures that our logic runs sequentially. I’ll go over each frame below:   Frame 1     Since this is a weekly lab, we rarely use the same hardware twice in a row. To combat the differences in accelerometers and DAQ boards, this first frame runs through a quick calibration sequence. It takes the input from the accelerometers and saves the x and y positions of both as Xai, Yai, Xbi, Ybi in order to calibrate the accelerometers (i is position number). This frame is repeated 7 times for 7 different positions.   Frame 2     This is the main loop of the code. Here it reads the values from the accelerometers and checks if they are holding still for long enough to continue. Waiting until the arms are still is crucial to ensure as few mistakes as possible.   Frame 3     This portion of the code uses the steady accelerometer readings from the last frame and compares against the calibration data from each position in order to determine the positions (1-7) that each hand is in. Though it looks messy, the use of many nested case structures was necessary to prevent LabVIEW from becoming too slow.   Frame 4     This frame takes the two positions from the last frame and checks against a dictionary of valid semaphore positions to decide whether they correspond to a valid letter and what letter that is. This letter is then appended to the end of the string being displayed on the front panel.   Calibration Analysis      Takes approximately 1 minute to finish calibration for all 7 positions   Initial testing(not calibrated): 13.04% correctness with letter translation   Improved testing(with calibration): 75% correctness with letter translation and word formation   String of letters that was supposed to read HELLOWORLD instead read HCELLO WORLDO   Most errors attributed to human arm positioning error; code was translating correctly, if not accurately to our desires   Issues we faced:     Accelerometers wouldn’t cooperate in regards to calibration   Ensuring the accelerometers were always planar was a challenge as even with a slight movement in the z direction it would interfere with the calibration data and therefore not produce letters during the actual translation   Changes we would make if we had more time:     Make the mount and entire set up more portable or easy to manage   Spend more time on clearing the clutter of the code (it’s overwhelming to look at)   Add a ‘send’ button to ensure no position was taken accidentally   Conclusion   Though there is a lot that we would like to improve upon, this project was a considerable jump in complexity compared other assignments in this lab. We got above a 100% on this final project and exceeded every expectation set upon us. We made custom wrist mounts with velcro straps, we had multi stage logic, and we succeeded in the goal we set out upon. This was truly an experience that I can be proud of, and looking back this was one of my more well-rounded projects in the early college years.   ","categories": [],
